This is a simple Towers Of Hanoi game. The objective is to move
all of the stacked disks from one location to another without
stacking larger disks on top of smaller ones.

About the Creator
-------------
My name is Darren Kent and I am graduate from Dixie State University with a Bachelors in Computer
Science. Throughout my life games have been my passion. From board games to card games and
ever since I got my first NES when I was a kid, video games. Over time I have developed many
skills that will help me in the future with making games. For a long time I worked as a graphic
artist and I decided to pursue a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I figured
with the skills I have, why not try my hand at making games and I have been loving it ever since.
